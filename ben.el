;; [4:28] Ian Eure: You will need these things: http://gist.github.com/457925
;; [4:28] Ian Eure: And http://gist.github.com/457933
;; [4:28] Ian Eure: Then M-x ssh RET hostname RET
;; [4:28] Ian Eure: Instead of M-x shell RET ssh hostname RET
;; [4:37] Benjamin Standefer: is the second gist also in ~/.emacs.d/ssh.el/
;; [4:37] Benjamin Standefer: err, ~/.emacs.d/ssh.el
;; [4:38] Ian Eure: No, you want it in ~/.emacs.d/init.el
;; [4:38] Ian Eure: The first form won't do anything. You want to M-x customize-variable that.
;; [4:38] Ian Eure: Also, I can't stop listening to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnCHCcveteA
;; [4:39] Benjamin Standefer: "first form" being lines 4-14 of the 2nd gist?
;; [4:39] Ian Eure: ssh-directory-tracking-mode
;; [4:39] Ian Eure: Is what you want to customize. Then remove that and the comment above.
;; [4:40] Benjamin Standefer: so that sets it up to be t?
;; [4:40] Ian Eure: When you customize it, you want to set it to t.
;; [4:40] Ian Eure: M-x customize-variable RET ssh-directory-tracking-mode RET
;; [4:41] Ian Eure: And for some reasonâ€¦ Uh.
;; [4:41] Ian Eure: You want to choose "ftp" from that list.
;; [4:41] Ian Eure: Don't ask why, it makes no sense.
;; [4:44] Benjamin Standefer: so the first 2 lines of the 2nd gist I do not paste into init.el
;; [4:44] Ian Eure: Correct.
;; [4:44] Benjamin Standefer: just the hooks
;; [4:44] Benjamin Standefer: ok
;; [4:44] Ian Eure: Yes.
